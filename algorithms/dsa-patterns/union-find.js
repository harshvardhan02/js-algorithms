// Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union Find is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
// It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.
